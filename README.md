# PyBer_Analysis
An analysis of ride sharing data by city type. 

**Overview**

This analysis was completed utilizing Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then using Pandas and Maplotlib, a multiple-line graph shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Laslty, a written report was complete to summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision=makers at PyBer. 

**Results**

Using the Pandas groupby() function, count() function, and sum() function methods on PyBer, we were able to get the "Total Rides", "Total Drivers", and "Total Fares". Further data analysis also gives the average fare per ride and "Average Fare per Driver".

To graph these results, the object-oriented interface method, the df.plot method, and the the Matplotlib "fivethirtyeight" graph style were used.
